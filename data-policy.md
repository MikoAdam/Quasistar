# Quasistr - Data Protection Policy

### Last Updated: 13.10.2024

## Introduction
At **Quasistr**, your privacy and data security are a priority. This policy explains how we handle data, including what we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect any personal data (e.g., name, email, location) through the **Quasistr** app.

## Anonymous Data Collection
**Quasistr** uses **Firebase Analytics** to collect anonymous data, such as app usage, session durations, and device information. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.

Firebase Analytics may collect:
- In-app events (e.g., game actions)
- Device information (OS version, screen size)
- Session duration

Firebase uses secure protocols to protect this information. See the [Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics) for more details.

## Children's Privacy
The **Quasistr** app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under this age. If you believe we have unintentionally collected such data, please contact us.

## Advertising and Third-Party Services
The **Quasistr** app is ad-free and does not use third-party advertising services.

## Data Security
Although we collect no personal data, **Quasistr** takes measures to secure all anonymous performance and analytics data collected via Firebase.

## GDPR Compliance
We comply with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. No personal data is processed, so requests for data deletion do not apply.

## Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy if new features affect how data is processed. You can always find the latest version of our policy [here](https://github.com/MikoAdam/Quasistar/blob/master/data-policy.md).
