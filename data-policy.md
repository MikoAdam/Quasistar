# Quasistr - Data Protection Policy

### Last Updated: 13.10.2024

## Introduction
At **Quasistr**, your privacy and data security are of utmost importance to us. This document outlines the data protection practices we follow and informs you about the types of data we may collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect or store any personal data, such as names, email addresses, or location data, through the **Quasistr** app. 

### Firebase Analytics
**Quasistr** uses Firebase Analytics for anonymous app usage data collection. This helps us understand how users interact with the game to improve the overall experience. However:
- **No personally identifiable information (PII)** is collected.
- Data collected includes information like session duration, in-app events, and device-specific data (such as OS version or screen size).
- Firebase Analytics complies with industry-standard security protocols to protect your data.

For more information on Firebase's privacy policy, please visit [Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics).

## Advertising and Third-Party Services
The **Quasistr** app is free from advertisements and in-app purchases. We do not share any data with third-party advertising services.

## Data Security
While no personal data is collected, **Quasistr** takes all reasonable technical measures to ensure the security of any information related to app performance or analytics that is gathered through Firebase.

## Changes to this Policy
We may update this Data Protection Policy if the app evolves to include new features that require changes in the way data is processed. You will always be able to find the latest version of the policy [here](https://github.com/MikoAdam/Quasistar/data-policy).
